# Solar-flare-detection-in-an-image

In this project we have used the SDO Benchmark dataset, which is available here: https://i4ds.github.io/SDOBenchmark/#dataset

We have used simple CNN models.

The file Solar_flare_detection_model contains the code for the building a dataset & CNN models. We have created 3 models which has 11, 9 & 7 hidden layers.

The file flare_detection contains the code for testing the models on unseen images.

We presented this Solarflare detection as a part of our Semester project named Solar flare detection & prediction using Machine Learning
